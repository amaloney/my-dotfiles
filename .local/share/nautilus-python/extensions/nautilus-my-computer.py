"""Entry point Nautilus loads directly. Its hyphenated name makes it
non-importable, so the real implementation -- MyComputerExtension, all app
state, and the Nautilus integration -- lives in nautilus_my_computer/main.py.
This file only resolves that package on sys.path and re-exports the provider
class; nautilus-python discovers it by introspecting this module's globals,
so the import below is all Nautilus needs to find it.
